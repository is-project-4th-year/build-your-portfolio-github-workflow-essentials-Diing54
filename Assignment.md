## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

- **Branching**: Helped me separate features logically, enabling focused development and minimizing conflicts when working on specific sections like navigation, projects, or about me.

- **Pull Requests**: Allowed me to review changes before merging them to the main branch. This helped ensure code quality and proper linking to the related issues.

- **Commit Conventions**: Using clear and descriptive commit messages improved traceability and helped me understand the purpose of each change.

- **GitHub Project Boards**: Visualizing tasks and their progress in columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) made it easy to stay organized and track completion of issues and milestones.
